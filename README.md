Lightweight Subnet Auditing Tool

This is a BASH script that will allow you to quickly audit all devices on a subnet. In this initial version, it's pretty tailored to the environment that I purposed it for. However I'm placed it on git so that I can begin to standardize it and bring in additional features.

If you would like to contribute, please do! Thanks!
